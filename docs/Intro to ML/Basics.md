## Defining Linear Boundaries

The most basic equation of a line is ```y = mx + c```. This leads us to the formulation of a
baseline linear function to be:

```wx + b = 0``` which essentially defines a line

# Perceptron

This basic algorithm is our intro to linear classifiers. The special part here is that it only
works on **sign(prediction)** and not on how good the actual prediction turns out.
