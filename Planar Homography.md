# Some Basics on Camera Projection

## Projection of 3D to 2D image plane

To understand how a camera views the 3D world, first we look at the projection of 
3D points onto an image plane. We use basic high school physics and some similar triangle properties
to derive the following formula:

![](/images/homography/0.png)

Notice that the minus sign is bit irritating to work with. (Also we don't see inverted images
as the formula suggests. This is becauase our brain does the inversion in real time)

Therefore, let's start with the below version of the formula by ignoring this inversion effect

![](/images/homography/1.png)

Now, the above equation can be written in matrix form, 
**but we'll form one artifact in this conversion i.e. lambda**

![](/images/homography/2.png)

It's clear that we can find this lambda as shown. However, why do we even need this? \
Ans. We want to represent the coordinates in **homogenous coordinates**

![](/images/homography/4.png)

## Camera Matrices

### Generic Representation

Now, let's add another constraint on this equation. Suppose we rotate our 3D point in space or we
rotate the camera itself by a certain angle. In the world of robotics we call such transforms as a 
rotation matrix. 

[Reference: Rotation Matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix)

To get a good grasp of rotation matrices, I highly recommend some linear algebra brush-up using 3B1B
(3 Blue 1 Brown). Specifically [(watch 8th minute of this video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYB8IZa5AuE&list=PL0-GT3co4r2y2YErbmuJw2L5tW4Ew2O5B&index=4&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown)
The rotation shown in the above video in the 8th minute **is a rotation matrix in 2D**. 

Now, adding a **3D translation** (just 3 numbers which add to the x,y,z component of a 3D vector) 
along with a **3D rotation** we get the **basic projection equation**

![](/images/homography/5.png)

*Where the two matrices are called the camera intrinsics (captures focal lengths) and the 
camera extrinsics (capturing rotation and translation)*

This rotation (r-matrix) can also be visualized as fixing a world coordinate frame onto some 
plane in the 3D world (think of a it as a flat table top) and then thinking 
how our camera is rotated w.r.t that frame:

![](/images/homography/10.png)

Now, most cameras also distort images due to lens optics or other properties inherent in building
the camera itself. These are captured as shown below:

![](/images/homography/8.png)

Now, adding these intrinsic and extrinsic factors, we get:

![](/images/homography/9.png)

### Alternate notation of camera matrices

# The Homography Situation

## Single View

Now, if we focus on only planes (table top and human holding camera situation): \
We can make certain simplifying assumptions. This is primarily that the 3D point we're looking at
has constant depth in it's immediate neighbourhood. Using this we simplify our equations to:

![](/images/homography/11.png)

**This 3x3 m-matrix now represents the mapping of 3D points on a plane to 2D point in an image**

## Multiple Views

Now, by simple extension of the above logic we can derive the following:
- We have just 1 plane in the 3D world
- We have two cameras looking at this plane
- Each camera has it's own 3x3 m-matrix which maps 3D plane points onto 2D image frame
- Therefore if two cameras can see the same 3D point, we can find a mapping between the two cameras
- This mapping between the two cameras is given by a new 3x3 matrix called the homography matrix

![](/images/homography/12.png)

![](/images/homography/13.png)

## Limitations of Planar Homography

1. When the scene is very far away from the camera, all objects can be said to have the same depth.
This is because the relative depth distances between foreground and background will be negligible in
comparison to the average scene depth. Therefore, in such cases all objects in scene can be said
to lie on a plane and as proved above, can be captured by two cameras related by a homography
matrix.

2. For nearby scenes where the variation in scene depth is more apparent, a homography mapping works
well only under pure rotation.

# Implementation of Homography Estimation

## The Pipeline

The main application of homography transforms is to find how some reference template has been warped
due to movement of the camera. This is seem below as:

![](/images/homography/15.png)

The applications of this are:
- image stitching (think of two images from two views as a warped version of view 0)
- augmented reality (projecting some images onto a fixed/known plane in the real world)

To perform any of the above cool applications, we first need to compute the homography between any
two views. The pipeline for this would be:

1. **Have one reference view and another view** with the camera having moved slightly
2. **Detect some keypoints** (interest points like corners/edges) in each image
3. **Describe these keypoints** in some way (maybe capture the histogram of pixel intensities 
   in a small patch around the keypoint)
4. **Match the keypoints** in one image to another using the keypoint descriptions
5. Use the spatial information of these matched keypoints (i.e. the x,y coordinates of 
   each of these keypoints) to **find the Homography matrix**
6. **Apply the homography matrix as a transformation on one of the images **to warp 
   and match the images


Let's go deeper into the each of the above steps:

### Keypoint Detection

- There are several methods to find keypoints in an image. Usually these keypoints are corners
  since other features like edges may warp or curve due to distortion and may be difficult to trace.
- The common methods are Harris Corner Detector, polygon fitting, FAST detectors etc.
- **Here we use the FAST detector**

![](/images/homography/16.png)


### Keypoint Descriptors

Common descriptors include BRIEF, ORB, SIFT etc. **Here we've used the BRIEF descriptor**

![](/images/homography/18.png)

The BRIEF descriptor works by creating a binary feature vector of a patch from random
(x,y) point pairs. This randomness in generating point pairs ensures changes in pixel
intensities are captuerd in multiple directions thereby being sensitive to a large variety of
edges or corners. The BRIEF descriptor also compares these binary strings using hamming distance
further reduces compute time.


Due to this computational cost of calculating histograms for each filter bank it 
would not make sense to use filterbanks instead of BRIEF. \
Further, just filterbanks cannot encode patch descriptions, i.e. without any
form of histograms (like SIFT), the filterbanks themselves cannot be used instead of BRIEF.

[Reference: BRIEF Descriptor](https://medium.com/data-breach/introduction-to-brief-binary-robust-independent-elementary-features-436f4a31a0e6)

The implementation of keypoint detection, description and matching are shown below:

        desc2, locs2 = computeBrief(I2, locs2)

        # Match features using the descriptors
        matches = briefMatch(desc1, desc2, ratio)
        print(f'Computed {matches.shape[0]} matches successfully')

        return matches, locs1, locs2

def briefMatch(desc1,desc2,ratio):

    matches = skimage.feature.match_descriptors(desc1,desc2,'hamming',cross_check=True,max_ratio=ratio)
    return matches
```

### Calculating the Homography Matrix

Let's say we have two images: **image1 and image2**

![](/images/homography/19.png)

To Derive the A matrix we undergo the following steps:

![](/images/homography/20.png)

![](/images/homography/21.png)

Where h is found by taking the SVD of A and choosing the eigen vector (with least eigen value)
which forms the null space of A.

    # make sure harry_potter image is same size as CV book

# Applying Homography Estimation in the Real World

## Basic cool applications

If we know how a template matches to a warped image, such as:

![](/images/homography/15.png)

We can then use this homography matrix to map any plane (here a different book cover) 
onto our destination image

## AR Video

Here we use the same book-cover homography mapping but onto a sequence of frames of a video

## Panorama Stitching

During my visit to Ohiopyle, I took few pictures of the river. 
Let's back to the fact that homography works well for far
away scenes, where the large distance from camera to landscape makes the relative distances of 
objects in the landscape negligible. In such cases even small translations of the camera have a 
small effect on the landscape itself. 

However, since the scene at ohiopyle was not too far away, any translation would yield a bad 
homography matrix and cause shoddy stitching. Therefore I tried to mitigate this by 
only rotating about my hip (to ensure no translational movement) while taking the two views.

The results of the stitching are shown below:
