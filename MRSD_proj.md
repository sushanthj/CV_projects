I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Robotic Systems Development at Carnegie Mellon University.

Our program is unique in that we emulate the systems engineering process which usually runs in
a robotics company. This process runs parallel to our capstone project where we build a robot,
secure funding and work within a budget, adhere to a timeline, and deliver on key performance
requirements.

I've been documenting my progress on the project work on a separate website which is accessed
by my peers occasionally.
