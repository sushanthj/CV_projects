# About Me

![](/images/DP.png)

I'm super interested in Computer Vision. This website was originally meant for me to revise topics
in vision. However, with SLAM, ML and DL, I've been learning a lot more on Robotics.

Presently, I'm pursuing my Master's in Robotics Systems Development at CMU.

Edhitha was a student team which has continuously taken part at the [AUVSI SUAS](https://suas-competition.org/)
competition held at Maryland, USA. I was part of the 2016 team where we finished 5th amongst 60 international teams
and was the team lead in 2017.
