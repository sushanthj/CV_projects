# About Me

![](/images/DP2.jpeg)

I'm Sushanth Jayanth, presently pursuing my Master's in Robotics Systems Development (MRSD) at CMU. I'm super interested in Computer Vision. This website was originally meant for me to revise topics
in vision. However, with SLAM, ML and DL, I've been learning a lot more on Robotics.

# Current Work

I'm currently doing part-time research at [Kantor Lab](https://labs.ri.cmu.edu/kantorlab/research/) at CMU's Field Robotics Center, working on Robotics for Agriculture. I work on a robotic grapevine pruning project involving 3D skeletonization of
grapevine pointclouds for pruning weight estimation.
